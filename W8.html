		<h1>Week 8 Response</h1>
			<h2>Animation Response Work</h2>

			<p id="Paragraph1">After taking Animation at Hunter, my appreciation for the art form has grown significantly. The process of Animation is a meticulous one even with the advent of technology. First and foremost you have to have a solid foundation of how you want things to both start and end. You have to juggle both time and motion through things like keyframes and  in betweens. If something falters between the two pieces of work it has shown that it can make or break your work. Even now with changing parameters in my own animation here with text, I still have not formatted a perfectly news ticker styled animation. Something I thought was interesting was how depending on budgeting and who handles certain parts of the animation, certain sections can look drastically different. One instance of this can be seen in Narutoâ€™s My Pain is Greater Than Yours Sequence.</p>
