					<h3>Net Art & Harvey Responses</h3> 
			</header>

		<div class="p1">
				<p>The runthrough of early net art was an experience. As per usual its space was filled with original artists who allowed for things to be created/flow freely. Over time people started to realize the capabilities of the internet and its use outside of communications and making money.(This would inevitably lead to corps wanting a piece of the pie.)In this revelation, many people utilized the internet to create art through outright coding websites. With these websites came a bit of everything heartfelt story telling, edgy disruptive tools, and the general parody/comedic sites. Each sector displayed a wide array of websites that are utilized to show off each artists’ ideas and the capabilities of the early internet. (As especially evident in the recreation of parody websites.)

				<p>Despite the initial distaste for the mention of NFTs the discussion brought about in Auriea Harvey’s work is an important one. For one she lays out her background in both sculpting and digital programming in its earliest form. With that she goes and traces her move through time interacting with both experiences and how they’ve gone to shape her life and how she utilizes both mediums to create something meaningful. Her concept of the digital world being borderless and expansive isn’t a new concept and her take on it is much like others where it needs to be expansively explored freely. She also goes on to mention the interconnectedness of her physical mediums of sculpting and its relationship with AR and digital scanning and sculpting. I did find her concept of using both to sort of time capsule moments endearing as it is something I strive for in photography.</p>
