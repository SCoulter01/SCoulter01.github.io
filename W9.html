                Medium Is the Massage- The main focus of the article is to highlight how the medium of certain ideas isn;t the most vital portion of an idea. How it is packaged also matters more as well if it is not more than the general idea. One specific instance that interested me was the discussion mentioned by Plato & Socrates. The duo go back and forth over the usage of song corresponding to speeches. In their time it was common for orators to share their stories by singing. However Plato criticized this form of communication as it didn’t leave an argument to clearly engage with. Connecting this back to the previous comments relating back to how messages are packaged, these things influence how people receive the message.

                One separate idea that came to mind reading this was that of Star Wars. Somewhere recently I saw that George Lucas originally had in mind to have the story of Star Wars relate to that of the United States and imperialism. Something that at the time wasn’t constantly at the forefront of American minds. The original plan was for the film to be an allegory for the war.
